# TODO list of *dst212bot*

- [ ] `/pogo`
  
  - [ ] ~~`/pogo` lets you choose data with buttons~~
  
  - [ ] pokedex:
    
    - [ ] duplicate regional forms (e.g. so that "alolan ninetales" and "ninetales alola" give the same result)
  
  - [ ] moves info?

- [ ] replace `/admin` command with dot-commands (`.add` instead of `/admin add` and so on, only admin/support/log chats)

- [ ] new command: `/timezone`

- [ ] `/wordfor` add buttons to browse previous and following definitions

- [ ] `/games`? Maybe some stuff like Snake, 2048, Atari Breakout and Tetris

- [ ] add examples (link to GIF on a channel to show how to use some commands)

- [ ] `/schedule` command

- [ ] group management commands like `!ban`, `!kick`, `!mute` and so on

# Known bugs

- [ ] `/pogo`
  
  - [ ] `ultra friend` not recognized as keyword (due to the ultra league)

- [ ] `/help &amp;` and similar uses of `&` don't get escaped

- [ ] `/encode b64 <any>` only accepts UTF-8 strings
